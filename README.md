snapshot_hosts.py
-----------

Script to perform backups on amazon ec2 hosts using snapshots.  Add hosts to SNAPSHOT_HOSTS if host needs to be backed up.  if a host has multiple volumes, a number will be postfixed to the snapshot name.  This script can also report backup status to nagios using NAGIOS_CMD_FILE.  if nagios isnt required, change NAGIOS_CMD_FILE to a log file.  This assumes you use a .boto file for your amazon credentials.
